# Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling.
This Power BI project visualizes and analyzes cleaned datasets through interactive dashboards. It complements the Python-based data cleaning pipeline in the repository by providing a visual representation of key insights from the processed data.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The dashboard built in `task 2.pbix` focuses on:

- Displaying summary statistics and trends from cleaned datasets
- Highlighting missing data patterns and distributions
- Providing filterable and interactive visuals for better exploration
- Supporting decision-making through visual analytics

---

## 📁 File Included

- `task 2.pbix`: The Power BI report file containing visuals, data model, and transformations

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- Cleaned datasets (from Python data cleaning pipeline)
- Power Query (for additional transformations within Power BI)

---

## 📊 Key Dashboard Features

- ✅ Cleaned and structured tables from real-world datasets
- 📉 Bar charts, line graphs, and KPI cards
- 📆 Date-wise analysis with slicers
- 🔍 Dynamic filtering by categories like region, product, or customer segments
- ⚠️ Highlighting of null or imputed values

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `task 2.pbix` using Power BI Desktop.
2. Navigate through the report pages.
3. Use slicers and filters to interact with the data.
4. (Optional) Replace data sources if you're using updated files.

## 🔄 Refreshing Data

If you want to link the dashboard to your own cleaned datasets:

1. Go to **Home > Transform Data > Data Source Settings**
2. Change the file path to your local version of the cleaned CSVs
3. Click **Refresh** to update visuals

---

## 📌 Notes

- This dashboard assumes input from cleaned CSVs produced by the Python pipeline.
- For best results, use it in combination with the data cleaning script from the [Data-Cleaning-and-Preprocessing](https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Cleaning-and-Preprocessing) repository.
